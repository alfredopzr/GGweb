Traffic and Mobility Studies
- Basis of design for infrastructure that enhances mobility within your site
- Preciselly simulated interactions between proposed projects and the existing road network

Job Site Controls
We quickly capture and model current site conditions for progress reporting and measure key parameters against plans and schedules.
- progress reporting (evm)
- resource efficiency
- robust logistic plans

Topography
Supported by the penetration capacity and range of our drones, we generate information of the highest quality and  precision. LiDAR allows us to go even further, managing to penetrate areas covered with dense vegetation for the generation of much more precise models and simulations.

Geograff Genesis
The Geospatial Intelligence package designed to empower entrepreneurs to make data-driven decisions about upcoming projects, Our comprehensive suite of tools includes:

Site capture, modeling, and analysis - geological, hydrological, and environmental characteristics, helping you make informed decisions about site selection and design

Demographic and economic analysis - In-depth insights into the population and economy of the area of interest. By analyzing data on factors such as age, income, education, employment, and industry trends, we can help you make informed decisions about site selection, market research, and business planning

Risk assessment - identify potential risks associated with a particular site, such as natural disasters, environmental hazards, or security risks

GIS - comprehensive database that incorporates all the components of the Genesis Package. The easily-accessible information empowers data-driven engineering and business decisions.
